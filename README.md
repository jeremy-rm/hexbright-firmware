# Operation
While the Hexbright is powered down, a *quick* press of the button will power up the Hexbright; repeated presses will increase power to the LED driver and then power down the Hexbright.

While the Hexbright is powered down, a *long* press of the button will power up the Hexbright in **standby mode**; repeated presses will increase power to the LED driver and then power down the Hexbright, exiting **standby mode**.

Holding the button while the LED driver is on will enter **dazzle mode** until released.

# Auto-Off
Once the Hexbright has been powered on for a period of time the next button press will always power down the Hexbright rather than cycle through the remaining power levels.

# Standby Mode
While in **standby mode** the Hexbright will automatically power down its LED driver after a period of inactivity, powering the LED driver again once movement is detected. While in **standby mode** the Hexbright will continue to consume minimal power.

# Dazzle Mode
While in **dazzle mode** the Hexbright will quickly and randomly strobe the LED driver at full power. As I am not an expert I will simply state that I believe **dazzle mode** should be used with great caution regarding photosensitive epilepsy.
